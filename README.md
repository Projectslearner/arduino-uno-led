# Arduino Uno To Control External LED 
This project demonstrates how to connect and control an external LED using an Arduino Uno. It’s a simple and fundamental project that introduces the basics of digital output.

In this project, an external LED is connected to the Arduino Uno, and the LED's state (on/off) is controlled via digital pin 13. The Arduino is programmed to blink the LED at regular intervals.

## Components:
  - Arduino Board
  - LED
  - Resistor(220 ohm)
  - Breadboard 
  - Jumper Wires

## Instructions
### 1.Connect the LED and Resistor:
- Place the LED on the breadboard.
- Connect the longer leg (anode) of the LED to pin 13 on the Arduino.
- Connect the shorter leg (cathode) of the LED to one end of the 220-ohm resistor.
- Connect the other end of the resistor to the GND (ground) pin on the Arduino.
### 2.Power the Arduino:
- Plug the Arduino into a USB port or power it with an external adapter.
### 3.Observe the LED:
- The LED should light up once the Arduino is powered.
